everyone's been Peters your house to your at Millennial commute got a very good episode for you guys coming*
a very special friend of mine his mother or his parents are my godparents and very very*
special bond with Robert and his family growing up he grew up in San Diego I was born in San Diego and so our families were very close*
growing up and so over the years we sort of see each other you know every two years or so and always enjoyed*
you know staying in touch with Robert see what he's what he's been doing and had the privilege of being able to attend his wedding I think that was*
was that two summers ago and hours that one summer ago so very happy to be able to sell*
I'll break that with him so Roberts thanks so much for joining me on the show today*
going to come visit you guys. Minnesota every couple years was always a blast that I knew when I was going out there that I would come home have an alarm*
a lot of mosquito bites so absolutely fun fact if you if you were at Peter's Resort*
and there's we've got this wi-fi login page and if you're scrolling down there's a picture of The Smiling probably 8 year old*
on a what do you what do you call those things that that you pull behind a boat what are you what are you call that a*
yeah water to there's this there's a little smiling eight-year-old Robert Stuckey so if you ever lied in the Peter's Sunset Beach Resort*
in wonder who the heck is that kid some people think it's me it's actually mysandiego brother*
so you grew up in San Diego*
serious growing up on me I know it so you know such a lovely area and sometimes I'm asking myself I wonder what it would be like to grow up there and get the*
the chance to go to HighSchool play sports and stuff like that could you talk about your experience there*
play scrape weather obviously and being so close to Mexico there was a strong mexican influence there and both*
Poseidon and being able to cross the border for various trips and fancy things over there too so I did take Spanish in high*
don't use it as much and as much as I would like to know what these days but it was cool to have a little bit of knowledge of that and*
one cool thing I did was as a soccer referee throughout high school and so I got to kind of travel around San Diego little*
do different levels of soccer from starting out with kind of little kids and eventually to*
adult leagues women's leagues in and it was really kind of conflict resolution*
just taking a beating because you're just a punching bag*
be able to manage that and tell me a lot of kind of how to stay calm in those kinds of situations and*
mladen just not getting Space by things as much anymore where I don't have a tendency to The Last Ship back or or have a strong*
action defuse conflict and said yeah yeah absolutely*
interpersonal skills that they develop playing sports I mean I can I can think of you know you know so many times on them*
basketball court someone would get totally just super angry at a teammate and then it would sort of have to like huddle together*
you know we're at we're actually on the same team here like come on guys like less let's figure out South*
just just for some context for the audience can you can you just talk about what you're up to now with your job*
yes so now I work as a mechanical engineer, manufacturing jobs specifically and my company*
solar turbines the name is misleading because it's not solar energy related but it's gas turbine engines and*
old engines so we bring the old engine disassembly rework the parts build it back up tested and then some*
I have certain process and after some more time*
those roles and then I would kind of graduate to a product engineer we're having to be responsible for 1*
2 engine lines the entire engine and Manufacturing Engineers working alongside me to make sure they're high quality inn*
getting out the door in a timely manner that's that's awesome I have a ton of respect for engineer's because I know the schooling is*
is very hard for that and very very rigorous and sometimes people would say*
Hotel school is so much easier than the engineering school and every sort of like today*
glad that we don't have to take all those like you know Advanced statistics calculus whatever classes*
kudos to you for four be able to make it through that it just sort of jumping back into the World of Sports*
fun fact about you that is so that's super cool I remember from my childhood sort of middle school years is sort of*
watching your journey from Minnesota when you're when you're seem almost made it to the Little League World Series of baseball*
everybody was totally stoked about how was that experience learn from that opportunity*
so it was 2007 and I was 12 years old and basically from May to August I just spent the entire summer*
wake up play baseball and no responsibilities other than that and we just kept advancing from San Diego*
Pacific District to the section to San Diego County to Southern California ended up going to the regional*
I'm representing Southern California and Northern California and a good memory from that was*
starting pitcher for that game and I was five foot nothing and the other kid pitching was over 6 feet and Fairfield*
Pledge of Allegiance together at looking up at him like*
unfortunately we lost to die*
so Arizona went to Williamsport for the Little League World Series in and we didn't make it and for those three Baseball fans out there Cody Bellinger*
turn on the Dodgers he was on that Arizona team hit a homerun against*
before the season started I told my parents that my goal was to make it to the regional*
championship game because that's the first game that would be on ESPN*
exactly where we made it to so what are the odds of that but it wasn't his amazing summer and I learned just another competitive*
just being a kid and just one of those Summers you'll never forget and just having a positive experience to look*
back on it was really awesome absolutely for those of you in the international audience people listening from different country*
say that correct me if I'm wrong in California's got to be one of the most competitive places for high school baseball*
it's quite impressive to know that you were you know that top team in in California*
open the top and middle school but it's all good*
middle school high school time frame*
involved in my church and this really cool organization called Fellowship of Christian athletes which kind of combines who am I*
passions faith and sports and what FCA does a lot of times has used pro athletes or college athletes*
all the way down to high school middle school and just kind of use that platform that influence to talk to people about faith and so*
I got involved in high school and became on the leadership team with my school and so we we brought in of course*
call Surfers and other athletes that could share their stories and and so we got to learn*
that was a pretty big part of my high school experience and volunteer*
area where I'm living now and that's that's been cool and other than that hang out with my family and taking trips with them*
High School baseball butt*
those are some main thing absolutely and I was just going to say I did not get any servers coming*
but maybe I can take some lessons and be the first person to get that*
started or something or maybe maybe one of my brother's can take that responsibility*
he is a great athlete at everything so if you'll be able to pick up surfing no problem and thank you for the compliment*
those who played beach volleyball with me might disagree with you but*
so I'm getting more into the leadership in volunteering could you talk a little bit about the experiences*
you've been involved in for both leadership and volunteering*
that has come from that is that I've had access to some really good mentors over the years especially in middle school and high*
I still keep in touch with mostly man but I keep in touch with these guys today and I'm eating being across the country*
those are some of my closer friends that I would say I will keep in touch with and just having people that looked out for me and wanted to develop*
Peter was really nice and and now that I'm a graduate of college and in the Working World something that I want to be able to give to*
non-return middle school high school
how big of a role they played in my life and so I want to do that now on the volunteering side I just kind of learned*
how simple things can be a great way to bond with people and some of the volunteering I did was because I chose to and someone's to rack up hours for Honor*
as it goes but I mean little things like picking up trash you can still talk with people and just get to know them as you do that*
and now I mean I feel like it's in that example in particular has helped me kind of see the environment as*
Caravan*
just little things like that can really shake you as well sure yeah I think one of the key takeaways from that is just sort of the eye*
idea of having the sort of healthy habits in terms of relationships with the organizations are involved in*
individuals you're interacting within just sort of like the community-at-large*
and the community you talk a little bit about your experience with FCA Fellowship of Christian athletes I know I played a couple of*
golf tournaments that were sponsored by FCA back in the day I know your faith has played a pretty fundamental role in your life can you talk about*
the first thing that it did was really made me how much*
Kinder person and want more humble as a kid I was kind of a punk kid I thought I was out*
but back at school at I was kind of a bully and I think a lot of it has to do with just hanging out with the wrong crowd*
my friends we just thought we were so cool and really weren't but once I kind of started taking my face*
learning more about the life of Jesus and how he lived in it really made me want to treat people better and so I kind of*
switching my main group of friends two people that I've met at church and and I've never been a person that like*
if I'm a Christian I have to only have Christian friends and I still have friends of all backgrounds and*
Core group of people that felt like really actually cared about me and still do to this day and*
just people that I surround myself with more in in the day-to-day is has been helpful.*
now it's going to be more perspective where I want to work hard*
disappointed go to college graduate and get a job and now working in my job but if things don't work out if I don't get that from*
if disease comes if something happens to my family it's okay I can I can*
I'm grateful for everyday and every breath that I'm given so it's just refreshing to*
that thing comes from God and and so*
my license still journey is something I'm still figuring out how to love people and really*
care about people with in the day today and I just figure out you know what the truth is and how to live it out*
a lot of times it's sort of put faith into the category of this is definitely*
you know over the course of your life and so you're you're always sort of focusing on your growth and your your role in*
in the community and and you know you're just sort of the the Journey of the self as it's sort of relates to*
everything that you're apart of and one of those one of the core tenets of this podcast or that I tried to make*
part of this podcast is just sort of holistic self development and personal growth and I think a lot of times*
people who are who are very professionally driven or maybe there's just one thing that they're super obsessed with you no like*
you know for me sometimes I fall into that trap a little bit like maybe you'll be my job or maybe it's what I'm doing in school and sometimes you lose sight of*
that bigger picture and I think you know one of the one of the fundamental takeaways I like people in the audience to have from this episode is just order*
you know taking a step back and be able to focus on that the more spiritual side of your life regardless than you know*
what's your religion or Creed is I think you know there's there's valuable takeaways from having a common you know it*
not common but a strong set of values that are going to influence your your behaviors for the pause*
yeah I completely agree I think I've gotten sworn to the the spiritual side of things without relay*
necessarily being involved to be doing more yoga recently and like it just so good for you breathing wise and*
mindfulness and all those benefits you get out of it and if people are living kind of on autopilot and just go go go and not released*
you know what is what is life's purpose questions*
we don't have to agree on what those answers are but I think I would encourage everybody to take a step back like you said an interesting*
search for truth for yourself and decide what you want to believe but but I don't think we should waste*
OurTime just Cruisin by not really thinking about those things yeah absolutely everybody knows at least one thing*
you know maybe it's maybe it's yoga for me it's swimming I think everyone's got at least one thing that sort of meditative and and get some sort of*
into that means that point where they're more able to take a step back and sort of look from a thousand*
feet up or whatever it is and just sort of be more positive and and philosophical about things so I'm glad*
that you're I haven't found the patience to sit still through I've been to a couple classes that something I'm on always*
going to try again it's just sort of thing has gotten away from me lately but fortunately swimming has has has been there for me I was not*
on the swim team in high school but really have embraced it you know now that I'm out here in my mid-twenties and*
I know that you were were a standout student in many ways in Heist one curious which which colleges or schools were you looking at*
back then so UCLA was definitely my Top Choice by far academics score*
think about it was awesome and I wanted to leave San Diego to try something new but didn't want to go too far so that ended up being my Top Choice*
unfortunately that's the most applied to school in the nation take a lot of people felt similarly to me and I wasn't able to get accepted and*
rejection is part of life and I was going to get everything you want and that's totally okay so*
alarm in UC schools Berkeley I guess but then get in there either and UC San Diego Irvine and and Baylor basically*
Taylor came on my radar was Robert Griffin the third won the Heisman by Junior High School*
find a school*
Christian School in high school*
the application was free and easy and took 20 minutes or no essays and stuff*
fun fact*
too much bad blood between you and your younger brother who is later*
admitted to UCLA I help*
about to graduate so absolutely saying that I work*
personally with doing the Consulting is okay what happened*
I've dedicated you know the majority last five whatever how many years to getting the heart*
you're going to Cornell are going to Yale and a lot of times I'm just like let's let's identify everything that*
do you want to get out of that experience at Harvard or Cornell or whatever happens to be and let's figure out how you can how you can make that expire*
periods and more from some other school and I guarantee that weekend we can expand that list and make that even bigger and say you know*
will you can you can accomplish all of these goals and you might even be more successful than you otherwise would have been and I know that*
a lot of people you know sometimes you get into that school which is maybe your your second or third choice*
and that's going to give you all the more motivation to really you know that use a baseball metaphor knock it out of the park when you get there how did*
how did you get involved while at Baylor*
a bailar Humane things I was involved in different organizations America*
which is the National Society of doing*
trips every year to install solar panels or did things like that and then also just helping out in the community*
NVM stand*
the show and so when I went to Baylor
call. Smolder and so the sex is called The Bear Pit and it went through some changes as I was a student there which is really cool.*
Drew Gooden Residence Inn*
Lucy and I want to see them
we had a great time so fine and then I was planning on playing on the club baseball team
here with me but realized it was still too much of a Time*
so I just kind of spread myself out with*
ended up wanting to core volleyball in sand volleyball*
absolutely summarize little bit of seems like you were professionally quite involved*
three or four*
start of get you more firmly grounded as an engineer and I I would assume that that would come with*
opportunities to Upper classmen Hoover engineer's in*
sort of more deaths into that community and then with the you know your your lifelong love of sports I mean just like me*
I was unfortunately not a D1 athlete but I definitely took full advantage of the intramurals and I think the most success*
Shuffle one I had was inner-tube water polo so*
I think I lost in either the Sammy's are the five*
final four basketball intramurals I think that one that was probably my biggest loss as a college*
definitely have some good times engineering it you're pretty involved with those clubs did you know*
I know you wanted to be a mechanical engineer when you got the campus and how your professional interests*
I didn't necessarily know I wanted to be a mechanical engineer right off the bat High School people ask me what*
oh how about engineering and I said okay cool yeah I'll go with that and then only thing that happened was I got a letter in the mail for*
collagen I'm sure I've gotten tons of college letter isn't immediately just throw in the recycle bin and not read them cuz they're random schools but*
school and it listed out all the different infinity and what kind of cruise you can have What fields and realize*
actually I think I'm going to take that one and then go for it and everything was just always really interesting*
engaged and never had any desire to anything else and so I'm stuck with it and was able to graduate*
as far as professional interest evolving I don't think I'm going to be your forever and kind of my plan for later in life is*
to become a high school math teacher so I had some Math teachers in high school Boston Teachers*
it just seemed like such a rewarding job 40s or 50s around that time frame I think I want to become a high school math*
teacher and in the meantime I do want it as an engineer as long as I get to do so*
because I know I'll be able to swim to something else*
that's awesome I didn't know about the the high school teacher thing but I was I was going to say I probably wouldn't be able to go back in*
class with you as my teacher but maybe*
Mr stacky*
maybe an engineer yourself that's great*
you know you're looking at the possibilities outside of you know what you're doing and you've got some sort of idea*
different different roles you might be playing in the edge near space and outside of it because I think a lot of times people can get sore*
almost paralyzed with fear by the idea of staying in one linear track when the reality is most of us are*
what I talked to talk to freshmen sophomores*
college and high school students and it's like okay*
you know there isn't always an exact logical connection between*
so that's all the more reason why you should do you know get involved in clubs and organizations and and go meet people and then see what's out there*
write definitely that's what people say about us Millennials that we're not staying in one thing for too long and I mean just being up with yours*
decided*
take this out it might be thinking about something else*
it's good to go either way but yeah the Millennials are always commuting*
so what are you up to now after Baylor I know you briefly touched just sort of*
yeah so as you mentioned I did get married graduated in 2017 and got married right after*
relationships but then of course then and was was*
realized*
other weed no reason to keep getting ready to get married so they died and my wife isn't physical therapy*
graduate next year and we're looking forward to that*
world and I've been here for two years as well and really enjoy Dallas*
Texas for six years now and it's been really good people and lots to do here and*
in my free time I try to play disc golf when I can that that was a hobby I developed during college and has it been*
the same sense because I really*
I'm going to start raining tonight and looking forward to running that absolutely yeah I'm still looking forward to running my*
first marathon I haven't set a date but I always tell me that I always tell people that I will be eventually running my first*
so it's a lot to dust for getting that scheduled and the first podcast*
episode I ever did was one of my best friends who I think has run 6 or 7 marathons now and*
just just incredible the amount of physical stamina and exertion that that goes into that so kudos to you*
also just wanted to imagine as a shout out to my Minnesota audience that you married a Minnesota girl so*
that's right*
like when I talk to her friends back in the day that would have kind of assumed I didn't know anything about Minnesota*
hanging out with you guys*
also an outstanding Place super beautiful and people are generally pretty active and*
being Outdoors Wichita Sam and just nice people and so I recommend taking the trip up there with whether you're a city person or a*
Country Hearth Inn & Suites*
you'll be moving into a tiny house this summer tell us what the deal is with that*
Portland on her honeymoon in had a blast there was a lot of fun and put it in the back of my mind*
January I was out doing something in my wife was at home scrolling through Facebook and saw tiny house for sale and realize*
okay well these things actually are really affordable and I came home and because Robert guess what we should do*
we should buy a tiny house*
actually I mean this would be a great adventure to do together we don't have the kids right now or were young and dumb and*
young dumb people doing*
play Silence by that out I think I don't think we'll stay there forever I mean our plan is about five years but I think even once were dying if we move into*
I think we won't ever have some huge I think I want to keep it simple and just focus on relationships and and just kind of reducer*
environmental footprint as well so I'm really sad about that is very exciting and I know that minimalism*
is great I sometimes run into trouble because people say your your apartment is so barren*
look like you you don't you don't even live here or something and I'm just like I've got way too much going on in my mind*
I fell. I just can't deal with it but living simply is always good*
now it's it's it's easy to get caught up and you know I need to fill my space with everything and I need to have a bigger bigger space and I just constantly*
I need to be surrounding myself. So so kudos to you guys for sort of embracing the the spirit of Simplicity and*
start living simply give you the opportunity and flexibility to you know just do Allah*
you know a lot more with your lives*
counter something about it so yeah yeah*
love to hear about that. Journey and end eventually if there's a Blog we could always make it back up with the with the show notes of*
today's episode so I once again my friend thank you so much for joining me on the show today absolutely a pleasure to have you*
yeah thank you so much for having me get to reconnect with you a little bit over the*
absolutely into today's episode my childhood friend*
Robert Stuckey who is now mechanical engineer extraordinaire down in Dallas*
I keep in touch with him over the years I think I feel like you know a really strong friendship with with him and the rest of his family even though we*
don't always get to see each other every year so so I'm really glad that Robert could join me on the Shelf so thanks everyone for tuning in and*
Tatiana show next time*
