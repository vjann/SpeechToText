everyone has been Peters your house at Millennial commute tomorrow is
no pretzel day so that's that's April 26th
I have a couple friends of mine a very special guests on the show today who are the co-founders of fatty Sundays
which is a pretzel Bakery they've got a store in Brooklyn New York and do a lot of
Distributing I've actually been trying some of their samples of the last week of incredibly good
so here with Lauren borowick and her sister Ali of fatty Sunday's is a Cornell business
the first place now that I've tried her dessert pretzels
they got some good promotions on their website with the Passover and Easter taking place
I highly recommend everyone listening to the show today head on over to their website at ww.w.
calm and that's Sunday is in day of the week not the ice cream to see what these ladies are putting down
everyday in Brooklyn and over the web
today
Lawrence are you mentioned that your mother is baking with the inspiration for a fatty Sundays
household where your mom was making the best baked
feel for you
eating lots of different treats brownies
she was the queen of care packages and just in general like you know
rainbow sprinkle pretzels were the inspiration behind fatty Sundays
and why we started this on the first place
that's awesome
kids in college were always the ones who got the best care packages
all throughout College I know that there is nothing more exciting then when you were studying for something Monday and then someone shows up with this giant
care package and then you know start sharing and everybody's everybody's dating and so it seems like you two would have would have
does the cool kids it's my understanding that neither of you went
college for baking or something with with the food
Ali-A graphic Communications
when you two were in highschool did you imagine that you would be business partners several years down the road
definitely not when I was in high school yesterday in college
middle school or Elementary School
Counting
play focuses and and still are with fatty Sundays in terms of language
accounting and finance
family but never
dreaming of a a business to realize we can make it work
go ahead
and then I went to The Graphic Communications route
starting a food business together even more impressive than because
what time is what I'm talking to entrepreneurs there was some sort of seed for their idea and working in a family business or maybe they've gotten
who's got some similar business or maybe their grandpa with some you know some high-profile entrepreneur so very
very impressive especially being toward the first in your in your family to be doing the entrepreneurship
and going outside a little bit I know that you're from talking with you you're in seeing what you've been doing on the website and you know.
your on-site pretzel Bakery it seems like your skills are pretty complementary
describe it to me is being sort of like a right brain left brain thing but for those of us who didn't
could you provide us with a little bit more on what you mean by that and how you work together
definitely have different brains like like the opposite we couldn't we death
which is amazing and when it's it's been very helpful
especially in the beginning I definitely have more of the creative side that you know
usual kind of brain and Lauren I like she said it's more of like a number crunching
operational Logistics
Lauren just really puts me in my place and
like anyone who is trying to figure out how to work the business especially with family it took us 2 minutes really figure out what
focus on and you know even though we didn't have the same skill sets we both want it's like do everything
we've definitely worked it out though and yeah it's just been it's it's just makes it
makes it clear when we when we're trying to work through things are figure things out what who can do why didn't we just try to stick to what we're best at
yeah that's that's awesome and getting into your education.
more did the two of you have cream jobs when you're in Lake High School College if we get sort of dig through the past a little bit
you remember specifically what was motivating you when you you know decide to go to Cornell or Binghamton or NYU
am I like I said I definitely thought I was going to work with kids or or working Seiko
I also love like art and design stuff so for second thought I'd be maybe working with
kids and art and then and then kind of switch gears was really into graphic design and and
went for that when I was like a dream job in high school
just like in my life I've always said like if I could if I did
to work. And I could do anything in the world like I would like to do like different things everyday or like every other day like
working like a flower shop and work with something sweet and then work with kids like that's always that like that doesn't exist
cool
I was supposed to work for in Sydney young and their audit Department
and then if I hadn't pursued fatty Sunday's was going to be on the track to become a CPA and
that was kind of always my focus I think since like being in the business program at Cornell
never really had other I always knew I'd be like in the business world
counting I thought that's definitely where I would start my career and kind of see where.
text me but things change
story and how you had that you had that opportunity
extend your offer so maybe you could start like a year later if you want to but then
turn there at the summer after my junior year at school I loved it got a full-time off
where to start in the end of the summer early fall after graduation so I would have been in 2012
January of 2012 and I just finished one of my classes when outside called Ali
Siri spoke about Saturday Sunday is another company was formed we hadn't really had a clear as to how we were
driving full-time
only if I've been quoted to say that I had an epiphany and could not
not pursue fatty Sundays full time to whatever extent I can figure out how to do that so I
I spoke to her parents moving back home if I were able to
my father heart attack
I was joking contacted my recruiter
girl for my start date I let her know that I had this opportunity that I needed to pursue and see
and I just needed 12 months to figure it out 6 months
listen to that time. And I formally decline the offer cuz we are
first of all kudos to you for being able to get an offer from the
from the top from the top firm like kudos to them for having some flexibility and then
kudos to you for being able to take this opportunity and run with it cuz I know like you know
with a lot of students a lot of them have real ideas and sometimes there can be no pressure to take the safe route
take a secure tracker you know maybe you know maybe both your parents are CPAs or both of your parents are
no working in sunfield and Southerners you know not necessarily an expectation but just sort of like a hey like
do this cuz it's going to be safe you know
again I deferred it I didn't decline it immediately and I think
the safe route right kind of
market research or any sort of game plan and that could be
overwhelming are problematic for the Long Haul but like I said we have been working on this for some time before that we knew
what we are getting into it was like I totally like clean slate on J why me it's pretty crazy company
Weber testing we are working on it job
call time we're in Sycamore comfortable position the most uncomfortable
yeah even your even you telling me that story I can see your analytical personality
so yeah I know you had
he previously worked as a graphic designer for equinox which is the hottest the trendiest Fitness company right now
I seem to be Crossing it in all the big cities and it seems like you know their their design is so on point that
you know people are out you know you almost shall out a couple hundred bucks fit to join the club just give it looks so awesome
could you know what you're doing
I graduated from
is a junior designer and work my way up to a graphic designer
I learned so much there and I also lost the brand I loved everything
search for the just like the messaging in that the visuals like it was so it was so great
2 years
obsessed with like at night or on the weekends
what I was doing an equinox and it just started to really take over
I did learn like so much so much at equinox
getting my skills and you know the visuals stuff I was doing for fatty Sundays
I did get a lot of experience in Equinox
at work so I didn't just like go cold turkey into fatty Sunday's I was doing a lot of
inside while we are getting fatty Sundays started right
people interested in entrepreneurship is
very very helpful if you have something that'll sort of keep you afloat financially
it's very common for people
doing something you know maybe it's maybe it's freelancing or maybe like teaching fitness clubs maybe it's
I need babysitting I know for me doing my admissions Consulting sort of my side hustle law and
also I will give you a lot more flexibility and freedom that that wouldn't necessarily, if you are
full-time nine-to-five job right
Equinox
work for me and I did a lot of work with my sister-in-law and
what I have to do that's right
started fatty Sunday's an idiot is talk a little bit about the day-to-day operations and how those of evolved over time
Highland and then we eventually decided that we needed to rent
for real and sell it and bring it to the masses
Holiday Market
a picture and make it work so we ended up moving
production space which is where we still are now with about a thousand square feet of kitchen and office
so that's how you know that's where to
definitely involved another sister who's a lawyer out in Colorado
but now he's got a team supporting us as part of our fatty Sundays family as we call
can't do it all ourselves
train people on to help we have like you know varying amounts of people helping at different times throughout the years
and then automated system you know a lot of it is still done
my hand so yeah it's definitely evolved
that's awesome and very inspirational for entrepreneurial people like me
yeah we might have some ideas or
actual business is in a lot of lot of my listeners are sort of got that entrepreneurial Spirit to some of that might be just
stops from getting started with their with their dream idea trying to take it to the next level I'm on.
what advice you too might have for people who are sort of thinking about turning their ideas into reality
one of the big things they always say and I very very true is like
Resurgens soul-searching and more research and more Googling and just like
really really thinking about the idea and seeing what's out there and how you can like differentiate
I was so obsessed with chocolate covered pretzels
Googling them and figuring out what we were going to do differently like especially in the beginning is still still now but
challenges of doing something I think like
are million percent sure of the idea and
passionate about it you know it only honestly gets harder as you get
every just obsessed
and I would also say the first time
opportunities is okay really saying focused again something
comes up but I think it's fine Jiang you know that
going after it like there's no tomorrow and it's okay to say no and really just like keep. Control
still learning to this day
right I think they're for people who are so
so passionate about helping other people and serving other other people
try to say yes to everything
that's right
first sort of look at each other and be like I think this is actually going to work like we're actually making attack
how did how did that feel
but I know we've made it I think it's every Milestone along the way I remember
like big order a hotel like this is it
Hotel in Chicago
Chicago is awesome
coffee shop this is like very very very early
Square holiday market
the first season we did that it was an actual like like it was the best and worst
outdoor markets 7 days a week
close
sure
those are some of the earlier ones
