hi everyone it's been tears your house here at Millennial commute join me
every week or conversations on College admissions and career planning whether you are looking to get in
is your green stool find your passion or just take his career to the next level I asked
questions will give you the answers you need from interviews with top performers from around the world
the short track full episodes this show is dedicated to give you the tools you need to pee
we're happy and fulfilled career so enjoy Today Show
today we've got an incredibly exciting conversation
with one of my friends who's out in sunny California her name is Chelsea
the Edwards doing some very exciting things she graduated recently from MIT
and now is at Caltech with Pasadena right
very very excited to have her on the show so I just
Epicurious will first Chelsea thanks for coming on the show
so you're a PhD student at Caltech recently graduated from MIT
chemical engineering so could you just tell us a little bit more about yourself
yeah sure I'm from Champaign Illinois which is basically we're up
university is in the US but I went to
Boston at MIT for undergrad and just became interested in chemical engineering
because it basically is a field that especially at the undergraduate
level combines chemistry and physics and biology
the application so if you don't
yeah and I really loved it so I wanted to keep doing
search in that area so now I'm going to tell
just like me dropping the Midwest Eye you said Champaign Illinois
singing affect the way you thought about colleges in education in general did being in the same
city is like a giant University your priorities
yeah I'm definitely I would say it champagne is bae
college town so it has a great Engineering University but it's pretty small
also basically there's a lot of resources there for students who are MO
motivated however I think fit in the midwest there tends to be more of an inch
stay at College where you grew up and
since my mom is both of my parents worked in Silicon Valley and
California
since my the rest of my family isn't really from the Midwest
I think my parents were always like yeah just tried to go elsewhere for college
okay so yeah but I think definitely
that I had access to growing up in like a small town with a lot of rain
resources was awesome cuz it's hard to find that concentration of available opportunity
in a big City where everybody wants them absolutely absolutely
motivating reasons for me doing what I do
because having also grown up in a small town where there wasn't quite
abundance of resources to put it kindly I had to do a lot of work on my
happy now to be able to be in a position where I can help people who are
maybe not so fortunate in terms of getting information about colleges and so
I first found out about you because you actually posted your resume
Keon 4 in response to a question about what were your credentials to get into
posted my resume on quora is kind of like a late-night like
truth or dare
completely
something like that
your resume is like holy crap in the rib blew up for a reason because
all these things I would like that's you know that's like Hermione and Harry Potter when she get it
change your so she can be taken like six different classes at one time is what
thought about you how are you how are you able to get so involved
ischool yeah well I think if I'm being perfectly honest
you kind of have to have a team of eight so I guess you don't have to
that my family was always there to support me the whole time
like my mom was on board with this idea
that if I was really successful at a number of things like most importantly
but I could have more options for what I could do with my life later
so I think that's why she really
stop me. Work hard in like study and
piano by the time then I was in highschool I was just
like ahead and those things and so it was easier to just
be able to spend a little bit last time on them that I otherwise would have but then also just
study classes more so
Foundation that's one thing that I had going for me even if even if I didn't necessarily have
resource that I did have a good mom
but I know my mom might be listening to this episode someday but she off
I always made sure that my brothers were reading books getting involved in things like that's obviously
helped out and made us more more ambitious and more motivate
to expand and further our studies what was your initial
motivation in applying to MIT and I'm curious where else you were looking at
actually yeah and I did want to say though that like
what your parents want like I think that just my own motivation was
basically the main factor why did all of these
don't despair if your parents if you don't have like it
resources that are used to like you can still do stuff
definitely why did I fight in my school so actually I
I want to go to Princeton for a while I guess for a couple of years
really really started thinking about colleges actually any colleges I wanted to go to
like Junior spring so it was rather late I think compared
what people think about or when they start thinking about it but
yeah and
local school
I got into both and then I really wanted to go to Princeton but
I think it's hard to tell if you're not directly familiar with the school
and so I was just looking at the ranking and I was like well do you know
Percy of Illinois even though it doesn't have this the same like
Princeton wood was actually better in bioengineering
mom so I sort of had this dilemma like well I could go to Princeton but then that's all
awkward because when I get it last good of a degree also there was this question
might as well just a bunch of other schools that are
for people to get into
Berkeley
Cornell engineering physics program
I think I just like
I guess they all thought that I was good enough and so
really likes in my keys live
Venus and I felt that they were making more down-to-earth than all the other IV Plus
so that I could maybe come out as more of a
similar to like the Giants
I think you might be the first person I've heard labeling labeling MIT is it down
regular person school but I'm glad
MIT is pretentious I'll be able to tell them that it's actually a perfect place for people
for normal and down-to-earth and a mighty how was the experience in could you maybe
we get like an elevator pitch on my high school students would want to go there maybe
set of Harvard righties or whatever like
right next door at home
it's just
I think in most cases the number of schools that people are interested in
I don't know if I can get into any of these and then they just see where they get into
how many people are in a situation where I could
all of the schools that I had considered may be wanting to go to
I guess if you were in that situation
already the University of Illinois and all these other schools had better engine
according to
so I think I guess it's a bit difficult to answer that question because I think each individual
probably need something different
so I guess if you think about MIT admissions
they basically just take the top people that perform in the international
Infidel gun firework
then some other people and not necessarily like just doing well
might not even be enough to get you in
the other people did that they didn't feel like I was able to do more research and undergrad
sorry I was able to do more research in high school
roommate freshman year was like one the one female
International physics Olympiad
and I tested out of all of the calculus
so I was still comparing myself to her and she was comparing herself to me and I
I think that that's just a common experience that a lot of people have so I can
describe
screen orientation the president of MIT is like how many of you guys like
confident that you know why we accept
a lot of people going with those type of feelings and then maybe after they
graduate and get into the real world
like okay maybe I have had some I don't know better
teaching in some of these other people I don't know
it's just always an adventure in an expiration but yeah I think
whatever reason
Goldwater Fellowship
basically only you can only nominate for people from your school for that
I think that that's a common way of thinking and I've heard
things like that and yeah
now that's that's fantastic.
Robert Wells of laying it out for people I think you did a pretty great job covering all the bases
ultimately getting into chemical engineering which I heard from my friends
Cornell who majored in chemical engineering is it's like the the hardest of all
call engineering's it's the I don't know what you want to call the Moby Dick of engineering
stripper whatever but but did you keep up your steamrolling peso
activity inside and outside the classroom at MIT like you did in high school
the answer is no actually I think that
in order to be in order to get into college I had
based on things that I thought you needed
extracurriculars in number of areas that you're a well-rounded person
graduate schools
next High School basically
research
it was also sort of a common feeling this
I ran into having gotten into great School
show the world really care about a lot of the stuff that I did
what you want your job to be later so I
it matters to you on a personal level
Stockton in making decisions or
learning things basically about anything
who are becoming more focused on their jobs
start whittling down off the other extracurricular activities
I had just have one of all of those things that I
awesome yeah that's that's really
applying like a highlight for the audiences you knew early on that you
I want to do PhD so you're very very focused and able to
block out the noise that I would call it of the other activities
on-campus these a lot of times I feel like we used to do there can be a little bit like almost a herd mentality
party where you know people are saying you all you have to do this you have to do that you know
it's it's difficult to the tip focusing and not get caught up in that
so it's it's impressive that you were able to you know doe of full out
you did on the academics and the research
that's very true I would say there's especially when the school has a lot of resources
actually there's so many things going on
College in your schedule is more free it's more difficult to decide or
actually important to you especially because ontology
for telling you so that you know what you want
but if you basically just decide on like
you're just have to agree to do something
yeah
that's great that's great so I really think that's that shows discipline
good strategic thinking because I think the hardest thing for
for very smart people to do sometimes is is make decisions about
about their future it's almost ironic but when you've been trained to be good at so many different things
and you got so many different options sometimes it's tempting to you know Keith
opening up your options and trying to explore more
more
you know
can do both of those things successfully
and you can work in most areas of engineering
yeah yeah
I'm just saying this is a half price
I think that people in the US
getting things done really quickly
dad and just figure out what you want
take some time away like that
things can be very
right now for some reason
nobody's going to care about that
yeah that's that's right perspective because I see a lot of people and sometimes even parents
sweats like doesn't matter what you do just do something and sell
I kind of knew what I wanted to do that
stay focused
that's right so speaking of advice and career planning I'd be curious
what advice tips or whatever do you have for high schoolers when it comes to
applying to colleges it sounds like you were very very Hands-On in terms of doing research on
different schools
is that I think people
think about colleges backwards sometimes
X College
I want to go to jail
try to do exactly what you want
do things more generally that they know college
extracurricular
School the most and figure out what
nourishing to your soul
I like music for focus on whatever you're doing
and then you can write about it because that's the whole reason
berkeley weather
if you actually know what you want because
so I think that maybe that could be more helpful way of thinking of
turns out that for you that thing is to go to a 2-year Community College
send it.
literally could be the best day ever
chemical engineering
financially
are some people that can really like
yeah I think yeah
love yourself as much as you can
that's what's going to get you through college.
that's great I would I would just highlight the point of looking
Beyond like the ranking of a particular school until like the culture and the more
experience-based intangible factors and the I find that this do
things to do that will probably be the happiest and fit in the most any way in
in addition to having you know higher chance of being admitted with his sword
it's like the first thing that people are looking for so great
well those are the questions I wanted to ask about your experience
I'm serious I know you mentioned some violin playing if for sulfur
free time now how do you how do you like spending you're probably living it limited free time
so I think that my free time transition stem during college I think in high school
I really just didn't sleep that much
socializing and school dances
occasionally hang out with
stop James Sports and teams and started doing just music like once a week
84 hours
eight sleep
on the day and be productive with only a high school
getting older is wonderful
and also just now
Saturday morning
by taking breaks and yeah I'm trying to keep violin
I think that I talk to so many
to do music seriously in high school who all told me
those are basically my things I think I'm more spontaneous now about my
people aren't ranking them anymore saying I go
and I want number one club in Pasadena
that's wonderful I definitely
stop playing cannot connect with you on those on the musical thing because I was always
playing trumpet to whatever in high school did a little bit in college but then
all right afterwards is just an immediate nothing so hopefully
be able to pick that up at some point in future but really enjoyed having you on the show today Channel
thanks so much for joining us here on millennial commute
thanks for absolutely absolutely so
talking with Chelsea Edwards today currently getting a Ph.D
Caltech in Pasadena California theater undergrad at MIT original
play from Champaign-Urbana Illinois I think my favorite parts of today
conversation were probably learning about how Chelsea
at such a mature approach to applying to schools I feel like a lot of people
come to me it's Earl I call you little bit confused and not really sure where you want to go and that's okay
okay but it's also sort of fun to see the perspective of someone who's like okay
I like this is sort of what I want to do here my options here the rankings and then sort of
no digging it out that way and then also enjoyed
running about you know a little bit more into the world of engineering
being outside of that never having taken any
math classes really are science classes
just made it so fun to do here that sort of perspective to self thanks everyone for
joining us on the show today August your house Ben Peters here at Millennial commute
you can check out what I'm doing on the website you can read my writing on quora
20 subscribe on iTunes I really enjoy when you guys leave me a 5-star review and
if you want to suggest any anyone to come on the show or any potential topics
please leave me a message on I www. Millennial commute. Com other
people aren't ranking them anymore saying I go
